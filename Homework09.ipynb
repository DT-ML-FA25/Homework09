    "It's challenging to define a set of functions that will perfectly order our flowers by color without first having to define very specific color values for filtering and corner-cases. At a high-level, we can imagine that this is because color is a $3$-dimensional value, and we're using it to organize our images into a single-dimensional order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beginning of our ordering is usually pretty good, since there's only one way for a color to be _close_ to our reference color, but the ordering gets less consistent towards the end because there are many different ways for a color to be _far_ from the reference color.\n",
    "\n",
